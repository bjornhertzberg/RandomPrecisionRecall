# Precision & Recall

Precision & Recall are two common measures to evaluate the quality of classification. For a given number available products and products that we recommend the measures are easy to use, but if we change one of the two comparisons are impossible. E.g. if we have 200 products that are grouped into 25 product groups, which model is better: 

- That we are recommending products 10 products out of the 200 products with a recall of 5%,
- ...or 2 products groups out of the 25 product groups with a recall of 10%?

As we will see in the notebook, the answer is not so trivial. With no other information given I would probably say the model on product group level performs better. Read the notebook to see why.
